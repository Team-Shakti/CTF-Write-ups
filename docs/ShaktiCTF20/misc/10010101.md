### Challenge Description

The story of initial six programmers is not over with them. They are going to recruit a team of fifty scientists to continue working on ENIAC. There are several spots for all of us and for that we need to solve this puzzle.I tried most of the conversions, but this seems to be a different language. I think the text file has something to do with the password of the zip file.

### Short writeup:

Use any online SPOON language decoder to get the password to open the zip file.
