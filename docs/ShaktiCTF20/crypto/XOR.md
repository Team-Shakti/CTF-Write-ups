### Description

Joan worked at Bletchley Park in the section known as Hut 8 and quickly became the only female practitioner of Banburismus, a cryptanalytic process developed by Alan Turing to break German ciphers. He came up with the idea when he noticed that every german message ended up with the same word “Heil Hitler!” . In other words the ciphertexts though different, they definitely knew that every text would end with the same plaintext


Can you use the analogy to get the flag here?



### Short Writeup
Xoring with known plaintext. Brute forcing one character
