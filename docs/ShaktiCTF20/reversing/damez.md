### Challenge Description
Oops! There was a sudden crash on Margret's system. She's afraid that she lost the passcode which she needs in urgency for running a simple prog which hopefully was backed up. Could you figure out the passcode and run the program successfully.

### Short writeup
String Compare. The flag is hardcoded in the binary. If you simply do `strings challfile` you get all the strings in the program. One of them is the flag. 

### Flag
shaktictf{K33p_th3_gam3_g0ing_gurl!}
