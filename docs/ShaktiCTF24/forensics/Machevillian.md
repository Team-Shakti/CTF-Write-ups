After going through the evidence provided we can conclude that Skype might be the means of communication platform that Freddy might have used as it is also shown in the most recently used folder.

To go through his chats go through the path:
```
C\Users\mayyoo\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Skype for Desktop\IndexedDB\file__0.indexeddb.leveldb\000030.ldb
```

Extract the file and use a text editor and got through it as all we want is the text info.

```
"Hello.Mr Mileman I am an associate of Prof. Simon Clarke I was told to give u some suggestions on your report .I shall sent you the corrections in a document please go through it and make the required changes."
```
From the above conversation it is clear that an unknow person tried to contact Freddy under the pretext of being an associate of `Professor Simon Clarke`.

Here we go the 1st part of the chall.

Going through the file you will realize that an screenshot has been saved in OneDrive of the user in the path:

```
\Users\mayyoo\OneDrive\Pictures\Screenshots\2024-02-08.png
```

The second part of the flag: `12/03/2024/12/45`

Going the recent docs file that can be found in the path 

```
\Users\mayyoo\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent
```
we can find a macro enabled file which looks suspicous and which was sent to him by the unknown contact which can be seen in the previous logs of Skype.

Third flag
`Corrections.docm`
