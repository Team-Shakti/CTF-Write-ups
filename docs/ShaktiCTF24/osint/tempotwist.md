**Description**
Last year, me and my family went on a trip. There was a watchtower nearby. Can you find the coordinates of the location of the watchtower? All I remember is the place's connection to this song.

Note: If the coordinates were (18.431957575736746, 134.77852817528785), the flag should have the next three digits of the coordinates after the decimal.

Sample Flag Format: shaktictf{18.431,134.778}

Please avoid any spaces in the flag.

In the description, it was mentioned the "place's connection to this song," so when searched for 'Kanmani anbodu song-related location" and found the 'Guna caves'

It was also given in the description that nearby there was a watch tower. When searching for a watch tower near Guna Caves, the map got this location: 'Moir Point'.

Take the coordinates.
"10.210508973013074, 77.4481630275408," and by modifying it according to flag format, the coordinates were
10.210,77.448
