# Encoding

## What is Encoding?
The shortest definition of Encoding will be *"Encoding is the process of changing data representation"*.

Rather, may be we should check this out :  
>*In computer technology, encoding is the process of applying a specific code, such as letters, symbols and numbers, to data for conversion into an equivalent cipher.*

The most common example would be changing "abc" to "ABC", the lower-to-upper encoding.

That was pretty basic! We also have a standard for converting characters. American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) was introduced just for that. Under ASCII, each character is given a unique decimal equivalent. That is, the character 'A' is given code 65, 'B' 66 and so on. You can see the complete reference by typing the following in your linux terminal. 
```bash
$ man ascii
```

Now, if you have done that, it's now clear that ASCII contains printable and nonprintable characters that represent uppercase and lowercase letters, symbols, punctuation marks and numbers.  In `man ascii`, you must have noticed that there was a seperate tab called oct and hex. These are different number system, which we will be covering below. So a string, "Hello" can be converted to ASCII as "72 101 108 108 111". This is how computers process information.


### Number System
- Binary
- Octal
- Decimal
- Hexadecimal

Decimal is the number system used around the world. But if you peep into Mathematical Computing, we have many number systems.
The most prevalent is **Binary**, which uses just 1's and 0's to represent data [Thus it is a base 2 number system]. Next we have **Octal** number system with base 8. Here, we use 8 digits to represent data, from 0,1,2 to 7. We also have hexadecimal, another commonly used system. Hexadecimal in fact means a base of 16. Since we only have 10 digits, we also use characters from A to F. So hex characters include 1,2,..,9,A,B,C,D,E and F, making a total of 16 digits. It is possible to convert data from
one system to another, but that is beyond the scope of this tutorial.


## Hex Encoding
Hex encoding is the process of changing data into hexadecimal representation. Having said that, Hexadecimal numerals are widely used by computer system designers and programmers, as they provide a more human-friendly representation of binary values. You can also try converting decimals and Strings to hex. 
Each hexadecimal character can be expanded into binary digits (A nibble). And it implies that a byte of data can be represented using two hex chars. Isn't that cool?

!!!note "Note on Prefixes"
    In order to differentiate between the representations, we have different prefixes added to the data.
    **\x** or **0x** is the generally accepted prefix added to hexadecimal string.


### A quick Example:
0000 of binary will convert to '0' of hex. Similarly, 'f' of hex will be 1111 of binary.
Taking a byte at a time -->
**0x00** is **0b00000000**, **0x01** is **0b00000001**, and so and so forth till **0x0f** represents **0b00001111** (The Decimal equivalent is 15). When we move further, **0x10** is **0b00010000** (Decimal 16) till **0xff** which is **0b11111111** (Decimal 255).

### The Encoding part
Recollect that each character is assigned a decimal equivalent in ASCII [from 0 to 255].
If we try to map it together, it turns out that each of the decimal equivalent can then be converted into hex.
That's it! The character '**A**' has decimal value of **65**, which converts to **0x41** in hex.

So next time we say **0x68656c6c6f**, be sure to convert it into **ASCII**. If you are too lazy (its common among hackers,) it's just "Hello" !

## Base64 Encoding
As mentioned, Hex had only 16 characters. But this one is still awesome. Meet the Base64, with 64 characters. Base64 encoding takes three bytes, each consisting of 8 bits. The following is the character set for Base64  -
1. [a-z]  -  26 characters
2. [A-Z]  -  26 characters
3. [0-9]  -  10 characters
4. [+]    -  1 character
5. [/]    -  1 character
Now that if you count, it will add up to 64.  It also have '=' character, which is solely used for padding purposes.

### Encoding
The process is really simple. Write down the binary of the message, taking groups of 6 in one block. Now compare each block with the binary or decimal value of the corresponding character in the Base64 Chart. Join the characters, and that's it. You're done! 

#### Padding
Always remember, your Base64 string length should be a multiple of 3. If not, you must add '=' character at the end untill it's a multiple. Padding is necessarity required for Base64 and it might save you from Padding errors.  
!!!tip "Pro Tips"
    And if you happen to see '=' at the end of the string, don't hesitate, try a Base64 decode!

## Hands-On
So where do you start?  We'll share you an 'WOW, THAT's AWESOME!' tip.  Forget all that boring pen paper calculation you have to do!  If you have a python shell, just simply type:

```python tab="Python"
    print "This_is_cool!".encode('hex')
```

```python tab="Output"
    546869735f69735f636f6f6c21
```

to print the Hex encoded string. To decode a hex string, just change it to

```python tab="Python"
    print "546869735f69735f636f6f6c21".decode('hex')
```

```python tab="Output"
    This_is_cool!
```

Similarly, you can do Base64 encoding with `.encode('base64')`
It's also fine if you're comfortable using online tools for these. At times, even they come handly!
