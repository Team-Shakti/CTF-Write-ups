# Welcome to ShaktiCTF Writeups

## Introduction

ShaktiCTF is a women-only CTF hosted by [TeamShakti](http://Team-Shakti.github.io/), the women-only CTF team of [Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri Campus](https://www.amrita.edu/amritapuri/). Bringing participants from five major continents(Asia, Europe, Africa, North and South America), the competition aimed to balance the existing gender gap in the field of cybersecurity by hosting a beginner friendly CTF on a women only playground and bringing more feminine power into the field. The competition had 49 challenges in domains ranging from Cryptography, Web Exploitation, Reverse Engineering and Forensics.
