#About Us

Team Shakti was formed in 2018 when a bunch of passion driven girls and a vision driven mentor decided to ‘Hack the Stereotypes’, the country's first women only Capture The Flag team. Mr.Vipin Pavithran had already established a few among the country’s leading student clubs: amFOSS, the student developer’s hub and bi0s, the hackers’ den. There is inadequate representation of women in the field of cybersecurity and Team Shakti was the spark of change.

The beginning is always the hardest, and the team had quite a few struggles trying to establish themselves. Due to the efforts of the team and the mentors, the club flourished. Here at Team Shakti, everyone strives their best to learn and teach others what we have learnt.

Team Shakti is characterised by its peer mentoring and the loving bond of sisterhood that teammates share with each other. Newbies are introduced into the field by the more experienced seniors. Overall, we are a group of motivated women who would support and encourage each other while venturing into the cyber world.
