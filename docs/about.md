# About Us

Team Shakti was formed in 2018 when a bunch of passion driven girls from [Amria School of Engineering](https://amrita.edu) with a vision and a passion driven mentor decided to '**Hack the Stereotypes**', building the country's first women only Capture The Flag team. Mr.Vipin Pavithran had already established a few among the country’s leading student clubs: **amFOSS**, the student developer’s hub and **bi0s**, the hackers’ den. There is inadequate representation of women in the field of cybersecurity and TeamShakti was the spark of change.

The beginning is always the hardest, and the team had to face its fair share of struggles trying to establish themselves. Due to the efforts of the team and the mentors, the club flourished. Here at TeamShakti, **we strive to learn** and **teach** others what we have learnt and that goal fuels our events - **ShaktiCTF** and [**ShaktiCon**](https://shakticon.com).

Team Shakti is characterised by its peer mentoring and the bond of sisterhood that teammates share with each other. Newbies are introduced into the field by the experienced seniors. Overall, we are a group of motivated women who would support and encourage each other while venturing into the cyber world to the best of our possibilities and try to bring about the difference we hope to see in the tech industry where women are highly underpresented.
